# ARM Cortex-M4 Linker Script and Startup Code Implementation

This project provides a simple implementation of a linker script, startup code, and Makefile for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers.

## Features

- **Linker Script**: Defines the memory layout of the microcontroller, including the memory regions such as flash, RAM, and peripherals.
- **Startup Code**: Initializes the microcontroller, including setting up the stack pointer, initializing data sections, and calling main().
- **Makefile**: Automates the build process , analyze  , debugging , allowing for easy compilation and linking of the project.
