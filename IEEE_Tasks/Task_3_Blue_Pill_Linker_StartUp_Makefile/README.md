# Blue Pill Startup Code and Linker Script Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Blue Pill Startup Code and Linker Script project! This project is designed to streamline 
the setup process for developing applications on the Blue Pill development board. The Blue Pill, based 
on the STM32 microcontroller, is widely used in embedded systems development, and this project aims to 
simplify the process of configuring a development environment for it.

## Features

### Startup Code
The project includes the necessary startup code for initializing the microcontroller. This code ensures 
that the microcontroller is properly initialized and ready to execute your application code.

### Linker Script
A linker script tailored specifically for the Blue Pill board is provided. This linker script ensures 
proper memory allocation for your application, allowing your code to run smoothly on the Blue Pill hardware.

### Makefile
To automate the build process, a Makefile is included in the project. With the Makefile, compiling your 
code and generating the binary file becomes a straightforward task. This simplifies the development 
workflow and allows you to focus more on writing your application logic.
